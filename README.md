# ♦️ MarbleSolitaire Overview ♠

## ℹ️ What is it?

MarbleSolitaire constructs a virtual version of Peg Solitaire for users to play using command line arguments or a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users can choose to play European, English, and Triangular Peg Solitaire game formats. They can also select the type and board size of the game they want to play, all using command-line arguments when they run the program.

I created this game to explore the Model, View, Controller design system. Prior to this experience, I was used to programming the functionality of my applications in central files rather than dividing files up and delegating roles. I truly learned how important it is to use a design system, and I feel that this project significantly strengthened my code design skills.

## 💻 Technologies

This game is fully created in Java using the Model, View, Controller (MVC) system. User can also interact with the program through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

TL;DR:

- Java
- Model, View, Controller (MVC)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
